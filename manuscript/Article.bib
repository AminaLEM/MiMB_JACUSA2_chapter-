The emerging field of epitranscriptomics examines nucleotide modifications in mRNA and their impact on gene expression. The low abundance of nucleotide modifications and technical limitations, however, have hampered systematic analysis of their occurrence and functions. Selective chemical and immunological identification of modified nucleotides has revealed global candidate topology maps for many modifications in mRNA, but further technical advances to increase confidence will be necessary. Single-molecule sequencing introduced by Oxford Nanopore now promises to overcome such limitations, and we summarize current progress with a particular focus on the bioinformatic challenges of this novel sequencing technology.},

N -methyladenosine (m A) is the most prominent mRNA modification, and is installed by a large methyltransferase complex (the m A 'writer'), not only specifically bound by RNA-binding proteins (the m A 'readers'), but also removed by demethylases (the m A 'erasers'). m A mRNA modifications have been linked to regulation at multiple steps in mRNA processing. In analogy to the regulation of gene expression by miRNAs, we propose that the main function of m A is post-transcriptional fine-tuning of gene expression. In contrast to miRNA regulation, which mostly reduces gene expression, we argue that m A provides a fast mean to post-transcriptionally maximize gene expression. Additionally, m A appears to have a second function during developmental transitions by targeting m A-marked transcripts for degradation.},

The structural diversity of the modified nucleosides provides regulatory potential to sort groups of RNAs for organized metabolism and functions, thus affecting gene expression. Recent years have witnessed a burst of interest in and understanding of RNA modification biology, thanks to the emerging transcriptome-wide sequencing methods for mapping modified sites, highly sensitive mass spectrometry for precise modification detection and quantification, and extensive characterization of the modification "effectors," including enzymes ("writers" and "erasers") that alter the modification level and binding proteins ("readers") that recognize the chemical marks. However, challenges remain due to the vast heterogeneity in expression abundance of different RNA species, further complicated by divergent cell-type-specific and tissue-specific expression and localization of the effectors as well as modifications. In this review, we highlight recent progress in understanding the function of N -methyladenosine (m A), the most abundant internal mark on eukaryotic mRNA, in light of the specific biological contexts of m A effectors. We emphasize the importance of context for RNA modification regulation and function.},

Transcriptome-wide m A mapping has revealed the distribution and pattern of m A in cellular RNAs, referred to as the epitranscriptome. These maps have revealed the specific mRNAs that are regulated by m A, providing mechanistic links connecting m A to cellular differentiation, cancer progression and other processes. The effects of m A on mRNA are mediated by an expanding list of m A readers and m A writer-complex components, as well as potential erasers that currently have unclear relevance to m A prevalence in the transcriptome. Here we review new and emerging methods to characterize and quantify the epitranscriptome, and we discuss new concepts - in some cases, controversies - regarding our understanding of the mechanisms and functions of m A readers, writers and erasers.},

Fast accumulating reports are recognizing and functionally characterizing several types of modifications across transcripts, which have created a new field of RNA study named epitranscriptomics. The most abundant modification found in messenger RNA (mRNA) is N6-methyladenosine (m  A). m  A addition is achieved by a large methyltransferase complex (MTC). The m  A-MTC is composed of the methyltransferases METTL3 and METTL14 as the catalytic core, and several protein factors necessary for its correct catalysis, which include WTAP, RBM15, VIRMA, HAKAI, and ZC3H13. To fully appreciate the relevance of this modification, it is important to dissect the basis for the MTC function as well as to define its interaction with other cellular partners. Here, we summarize previous and recent knowledge on these issues to provide a guide for future research and put forward ideas on the flexibility and specificity of this process.

This demethylation activity of ALKBH5 significantly affects mRNA export and RNA metabolism as well as the assembly of mRNA processing factors in nuclear speckles. Alkbh5-deficient male mice have increased m(6)A in mRNA and are characterized by impaired fertility resulting from apoptosis that affects meiotic metaphase-stage spermatocytes. In accordance with this defect, we have identified in mouse testes 1,551 differentially expressed genes that cover broad functional categories and include spermatogenesis-related mRNAs involved in the p53 functional interaction network.

Although biochemical studies indicate that N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most prevalent internal modification in messenger RNA, an in-depth study of its distribution and functions has been impeded by a lack of robust analytical methods. Here we present the human and mouse m(6)A modification landscape in a transcriptome-wide manner, using a novel approach, m(6)A-seq, based on antibody-mediated capture and massively parallel sequencing. We identify over 12,000 m(6)A sites characterized by a typical consensus in the transcripts of more than 7,000 human genes. Sites preferentially appear in two distinct landmarks--around stop codons and within long internal exons--and are highly conserved between human and mouse. Although most sites are well preserved across normal and cancerous tissues and in response to various stimuli, a subset of stimulus-dependent, dynamically modulated sites is identified. Silencing the m(6)A methyltransferase significantly affects gene expression and alternative splicing patterns, resulting in modulation of the p53 (also known as TP53) signalling pathway and apoptosis. Our findings therefore suggest that RNA decoration by m(6)A has a fundamental role in regulation of gene expression.},

The recent discovery that FTO, an obesity risk gene, encodes an m(6)A demethylase implicates m(6)A as an important regulator of physiological processes. Here, we present a method for transcriptome-wide m(6)A localization, which combines m(6)A-specific methylated RNA immunoprecipitation with next-generation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq). We use this method to identify mRNAs of 7,676 mammalian genes that contain m(6)A, indicating that m(6)A is a common base modification of mRNA. The m(6)A modification exhibits tissue-specific regulation and is markedly increased throughout brain development. We find that m(6)A sites are enriched near stop codons and in 3' UTRs, and we uncover an association between m(6)A residues and microRNA-binding sites within 3' UTRs. These findings provide a resource for identifying transcripts that are substrates for adenosine methylation and reveal insights into the epigenetic regulation of the mammalian transcriptome.},

Similar to the critical role of chemical modifications in regulation of DNA and protein activities, RNA m(6)A modification is also observed to be involved in the regulation of diverse functions of RNAs including meiosis, fertility, development, cell reprogramming and circadian period. The RNA m(6)A modification is recognized by YTH domain containing family proteins comprising of YTHDC1-2 and YTHDF1-3. Here we focus on the nuclear m(6)A reader YTHDC1 and its regulatory role in alternative splicing and other RNA metabolic processes.},

While the 5' cap modification and the poly(A) tail of eukaryotic mRNA play key roles in regulation, internal modifications are gaining attention for their roles in mRNA metabolism. The most abundant internal mRNA modification is N -methyladenosine (m A), and identification of proteins that install, recognize, and remove this and other marks have revealed roles for mRNA modification in nearly every aspect of the mRNA life cycle, as well as in various cellular, developmental, and disease processes. Abundant noncoding RNAs such as tRNAs, rRNAs, and spliceosomal RNAs are also heavily modified and depend on the modifications for their biogenesis and function. Our understanding of the biological contributions of these different chemical modifications is beginning to take shape, but it's clear that in both coding and noncoding RNAs, dynamic modifications represent a new layer of control of genetic information.},
